💳 Credit Card Fraud & Risk Detection

A Machine Learning project to detect fraudulent credit card transactions and assess transaction risk. This project leverages data science, feature engineering, and classification algorithms to identify suspicious activities, helping financial institutions minimize losses and enhance transaction security.

🚀 Project Overview

Credit card fraud is one of the most common issues in the financial sector. The objective of this project is to build a predictive model that:

Classifies whether a transaction is fraudulent or legitimate.

Provides a risk score to indicate the likelihood of fraud.

Helps financial institutions in real-time monitoring of transactions.

🛠️ Tech Stack

📊 Dataset

Source: Kaggle - Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset

Description: Contains anonymized transactions made by European cardholders in September 2013.

Size: 284,807 transactions with 492 frauds (highly imbalanced dataset).

🔑 Key Features

Data Preprocessing: Handling imbalanced data using SMOTE/undersampling.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding transaction patterns.

Modeling: Training multiple ML models for fraud classification.

Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC.

Risk Scoring: Assigning probability-based fraud risk scores.

📈 Results
